Note that I have set all values to zero if the z score was below 3. So all coloured squares show significant excess of allele sharing.

The melpomene.balTree_tree.txt contains the D statistics, the fbranch.Z.txt file contains all fbranch and z scores  (including non-significant ones) and fbranch.signOnly.txt contains the fbranch values used for the matrix.

fbranch basically summarizes multiple Dstats or rather f4 ratio values.
